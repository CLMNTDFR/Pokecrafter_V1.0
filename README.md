## üìù OVERVIEW
**POKE-CRAFTER** is a web application that combines the world of Pok√©mon with creativity and digital art. The project allows users to **create** and **share** works inspired by the Pok√©mon universe, with a strong emphasis on **community** and **social interaction**.

Users can explore works by category (AI, HandCraft, Digital Art, 3D, and Other), support their favorite artists, and actively participate in the community's life.
